Caffeine is a computer malware, more specifically a fully undetectable key logger. The malware copies itself in a hidden windows directory and logs all the key presses. It stores them in a text file adding the timestamp of each key press, in addition to a confidential file of your choice and mails it to a specific email address each time the computer starts .
